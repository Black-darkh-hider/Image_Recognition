## &#x20;How to Run

### Open in Google Colab

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yourusername/your-repo/blob/main/your_notebook.ipynb)

### Clone and Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
# Open the notebook in Jupyter or Colab
```

## Datasets â€” Source & Description

* **MNIST Dataset**: A classic collection of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (60,000 for training, 10,000 for testing) ([Kaggle][1], [Wikipedia][2]).
* **Cats & Dogs Dataset**: A widely used binary classification dataset of cat and dog images, perfect for model-building practice ([Kaggle][3]).

---

## Kaggle API Note

When using Kaggle datasets in Colab, upload your **`kaggle.json`** credentials file. If you see:

```
Upload widget is only available when the cell has been executed in the current browser session. Please rerun this cell to enable.
Saving kaggle.json to kaggle.json
```

This indicates you need to rerun the upload cell before proceeding.

## Key Features

* ðŸ“¥ **Dataset Handling**: Download and preprocess the **MNIST** and **Cats & Dogs** datasets from Kaggle.
* ðŸ“Š **Visualization**: Visualize samples and distributions using Matplotlib.
* ðŸ§  **Custom CNNs**: Build, train, and evaluate convolutional neural networks using Keras.
* ðŸ”„ **Data Augmentation**: Use techniques like image transformations and batch normalization to improve model robustness.
* âš¡ **Transfer Learning**: Leverage MobileNetV2 to accelerate performance on more complex datasets.
* ðŸ“ˆ **Model Evaluation**: Generate confusion matrices, classification reports, and ROC/AUC curves.
* ðŸ’¾ **Model Persistence**: Save, reload, and deploy trained models seamlessly.
